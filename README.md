# quick-image-downloader
Small 30 mminute script to scrape from the console and download images in batch

## Motivation

I had to "right-click" and "save as..." more than 4 times, so I wrote this little srcaper to be pasted on the console to get a list of URLs as JSON and then just donload them.

## Usage

* edit the `scraper.js` file to your liking to get the list of URLs
* Click the **download** button generated by the script
* Put the downloaded file next to the root of the repo
* Rename the downloaded file to `list-of-files.json`
* From the console run `node index`
* When the files are downloaded there will be a success message.
